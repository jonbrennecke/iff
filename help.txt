Iff is a package manager for Matlab/Octave.

Usage: iff [options]

  Options:
    install <package>   Query the API for a given package; and if it's found,
                        download it, unpack it and add it to the matlab path.

    init [folder]       Interactively create a package structure in a folder (or
                        the current directory, if no folder is provided).

    publish [folder]    If 'folder' is a module, publish the module by
                        registering it with the API.

    build <target>		If 'build' is specified in the manifest file 'iff.json', then use the build description to 						compile the C or C++ MEX files.  By default, iff looks for a rule named 'default'.  Or, if 						there are no named rules (or only one) then iff builds the only rule in the project.

    config <key=value>  Set a key value pair in the config file.

    help                Display this prompt.
